# Exp03 Tutor

## 1. Install VMWare Workstation Pro

## 2. Download Ubuntu 23 Desktop iso File

Official website: [link](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

Official CD mirrors: [link](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors).

Download the file named something like "**ubuntu-23.10.1-desktop-amd64.iso**".

## 3. Install Three Ubuntu 23 Virtual Machines in VMWare

ðŸ’¡**Note**:
- Set the computer name (host name) to be "**node1**", "**node2**" and "**node3**" repectively.
- Create users with **the same username** on each virtual machine.

> ***Why do we need to set the same username?***  
> When using MPI to run a program on multiple nodes, we need to share the program and data between these nodes.   
> The "share" process is done by **passwordless ssh**, which requires the same username on every node.  
> For example, when user "james" on node1 runs `ssh node2`, the system will try to login as "james" on node2.

## 4. Environment Setup

### 4.1. Software Installation

Run following commands on every virtual machine:

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop
```

Restart every virtual machine, and now you are able to copy and paste any content or files from your host machine to the virtual machines!

Install some other softwares on every virtual machine:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git vim-gtk3 openssh-server m4 libcurl4-openssl-dev

# Turn down the firewall for ssh:
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

### 4.2. SSH Key Generation

Generate ssh keys on every virtual machine:

```bash
# Replace <username> with your current username
# Replace <1/2/3> with the corresponding number of the virtual machine
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<username>@node<1/2/3>"
```

You should be able to find the generated keys in `~/.ssh/` directory.

### 4.3. SSH Key Sharing

Check the ip address of every virtual machine:

```bash
ip a
```

Suppose you get following results:

| Host Name | IP Address |
| :---: | :---: |
| node1 | 192.168.x.10 |
| node2 | 192.168.x.11 |
| node3 | 192.168.x.12 |

ðŸ’¡**Note**: 
- These IP addresses are just examples, you should replace them with your own IP addresses.
- Try to ping every virtual machine from each other to make sure they can communicate with each other.

Share the public key of every virtual machine to every other virtual machine:

```bash
# Replace <username> with your current username. All the virtual machines should have the same username.
# Replace <IP-Address> with the corresponding IP address of the virtual machine
ssh-copy-id <username>@<IP-Address>
```

The public keys are now written to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on every virtual machine.

### 4.4. Hosts File Configuration

Edit the "/etc/hosts" on every virtual machine with command `sudo vim /etc/hosts`. Add following lines to the file:

```bash
# [Note]:
#   In "/etc/hosts", if there are something like: 
#   > 127.0.1.1 node<1/2/3>
#   Remove this line or comment it out 
#   by adding a `#` at the beginning of the line.

# Replace `192.168.x.10`, `192.168.x.11` and `192.168.x.12` with your own IP addresses.
192.168.x.10 node1
192.168.x.11 node2
192.168.x.12 node3
```

### 4.5. Reboot Every Virtual Machine

Reboot every virtual machine. 

### 4.6. Try to SSH to Every Virtual Machine

From every virtual machine, SSH to each other, including itself:

```bash
# Now you are in nodeX
ssh node1
# Now you are in node1
exit
# Now back to nodeX
ssh node2
# Now you are in node2
exit
# Now back to nodeX
ssh node3
# Now you are in node3
exit
# Now back to nodeX
```

## 5. Install zlib

Run following command to install zlib:

```bash
sudo apt install -y zlib1g-dev
```

> ***Why do we need to install zlib?***  
> zlib is a software library used for data compression.  
> It is used by OpenMPI to compress data during communication between different nodes.

## 6. Install openmpi

Download source code of openmpi from the official website [[link](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/)].

Supposed the file you downloaded is named **openmpi-5.0.3.tar.bz2**.  

Open your terminal and change directory to the path of the compressed file.

```bash
# Extact the file, and you will get a folder named "openmpi-5.0.3"
tar -xf openmpi-5.0.3.tar.bz2

cd ./openmpi-5.0.3

# If you have cuda installed, you can add "--with-cuda=/path/to/cuda" to the following command.
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/openmpi-5.0.3 --with-zlib

make -j $(nproc) all

sudo make install
```

Edit **/etc/bash.bashrc** file with command `sudo vim /etc/bash.bashrc`, add following lines to the end of that file:

```bash
# >>> openmpi >>>
export OPENMPI_HOME="/usr/local/openmpi-5.0.3"
alias OPENMPI_INIT="export PATH=$OPENMPI_HOME/bin:$PATH && export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$OPENMPI_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
# <<< openmpi <<<
```

Now, every time you open a new terminal, you can initialize the environment of OpenMPI with the following command: 

```bash
OPENMPI_INIT
```

You can also check the path of mpi executables after initialized the environment:

```bash
# Check where is mpicxx
which mpicxx
# Check where is mpirun
which mpirun
```

## 7. Build MPI Program

ðŸ’¡**Note**: 
- Following steps should be done on every virtual machine.

### 7.1. Clone the Project

Clone ***this*** project if you haven't done it yet:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:jamesnulliu/SHU-Computer-System-Architecture-Experiments.git SHU-CSAE

cd SHU-CSAE
```

### 7.2. Build Yutils

Yutils is a submoudle and shuold be built once for all.

```bash
bash scripts/build-libs.sh
```

After building, you should be able to find "libYutils.a" in "./vendor/Yutils/lib/" directory.

ðŸ’¡**Note**: 
- You don't have to build yutils again if you have already built it.

### 7.3. Build Exp03

```bash
OPENMPI_INIT

CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx bash scripts/build-exp03.sh
```

You should be able to find the executable file named "exp03" in "./exp03-mpi/bin" directory.

### 7.4. Create a Hostfile

Create a hostfile named "hostfile" in the "./" directory. Write following lines to the file:

```bash
# `slots` is the number of processes you want to run on each node.
# `node<1/2/3>` are ip addresses defined in "/etc/hosts".

node1 slots=2
node2 slots=2
node3 slots=2
```

### 7.5. Run the Program

Run the program with following command; Replace `<nProcess>` with the overall number of processes you want to run:

```bash
mpiexec --hostfile hostfile -np <nProcesses> ./exp03-mpi/bin/Release/Linux_x86_64/hellompi
```

You should be able to see some output like:

```
Hello, I am rank 5
Hello, I am rank 3
Hello, I am rank 4
Hello, I am rank 2
Hello, I am rank 1
Hello, I am rank 0
```
